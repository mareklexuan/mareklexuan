# Hello there, I'm Marek Le Xuan 👋

### Project Management • AI • Productivity • 📅🤖⚡

<br>

I am a problem solver, innovator and essentialist. A project manager, leader and educator. To every challenge I say: "No problem" and I iterate through it. Something needs to be taken care of? I am your man. They call me "The Wolf". 🐺
 
I like creating and building things, I like the process of testing and iterating, connecting all the pieces and seeing the project grow. But at the same time, I like order, clear documentation, everything planned, transparent and accessible. 📅

You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems and processes. I am always on a lookout for new tools to make my work and my life more efficient. ⚡

I am interested in tech, SaaS tools and now catching up on latest generative AI tools and how to implement them into business. 🤖

Did we vibe? Let's connect! 🤝 (extra points if you get the reference)

## Learning web dev with Jekyll 💻

I'm a self-taught web dev (HTML/CSS) and Jekyll hobbyist, learning through trial and error, and using Jekyll to create my personal website. I am sharing my experience and what I have learned in my [Jekyll tips & tricks repository](https://github.com/mareklexuan/jekyll-tips-tricks).
