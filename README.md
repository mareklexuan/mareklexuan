# Hello there, I'm Marek Le Xuan ðŸ‘‹

### Project â€¢ Product â€¢ Productivity

<br>

I am Project Management and Operations leader with almost 10 years of experience in tech, in fast-paced and dynamic startups like Kiwi.com and ContentKing.

I am leading and mentoring project management teams, developing processes for scalable growth and efficient project execution, overseeing the end-to-end delivery of software development and operational projects, managing both clients and delivery teams, and driving collaboration and effective communication.

I am responsible for strategic planning and execution, defining project roadmaps and planning resources. As part of the top leadership team, I also contribute in shaping the companyâ€™s strategic direction and planning long-term goals, ensuring alignment across all teams, and driving organizational success and growth.

I hold PRINCE2 project management and Scrum Master certifications, with experience in both Agile (Scrum, Kanban, scaled Spotify model) and more traditional waterfall environments.

## Learning web dev with Jekyll ðŸ’»

I'm a self-taught web dev (HTML/CSS) and Jekyll hobbyist, learning through trial and error, and using Jekyll to create my personal website. I am sharing my experience and what I have learned in my [Jekyll tips & tricks repository](https://github.com/mareklexuan/jekyll-tips-tricks).
