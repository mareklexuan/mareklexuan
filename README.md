### Operational Excellence â€¢ Productivity â€¢ Digitalization â€¢ Automation

<br>

You do not rise to the level of your goals and plans. 

You fall to the level of your systems and processes. 

Everybody wants to make more and sell more, but in order to succeed, you need the system that will take care of it. Well-made processes ensure consistent high quality of work and prevent wasting time and money.

I am a firm believer in operational excellence through continuous improvements. Everything is changing, so should we and our processes. We need to constantly adapt to keep up and improve our productivity.

Well defined and documented processes will:

-âš¡ Ensure delivering your product or service in consistent high quality
-âš¡ Save time and money wasted figuring out how to do the work
-âš¡ Empower your people to handle even the challenging tasks
-âš¡ Allow streamlined scaling of your team and business
-âš¡ Open new opportunities for digitalization, optimization and automation

If that's what you're looking forâ€”let's talk.

## Learning web dev with Jekyll ðŸ’»

I'm a self-taught web dev (HTML/CSS) and Jekyll hobbyist, learning through trial and error, and using Jekyll to create my personal website. I am sharing my experience and what I have learned in my [Jekyll tips & tricks repository](https://github.com/mareklexuan/jekyll-tips-tricks).
