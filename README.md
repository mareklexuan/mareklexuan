# Hello there, I'm Marek Le Xuan ðŸ‘‹

### Life Design | Self-Management | Personal Betterment

<br>

I am a problem solver, innovator, educator, mentor, essentialist and blogger. I talk about life design, self-management and personal betterment. About building a better life.

I believe everybody needs to take responsibility for our lives, take a long hard look in the mirror and be honest with ourselves - the only person who is really going to care about you is you. Nobody is coming to save you, to fix your life. It is all in your hands.

Every day is an opportunity to better ourselves and the world around us. Our health, our environment, our relationships, our work, or service and help others. Carpe diem.

And I want to share my path and hopefully inspire others to make their lives better, make them amazing, and do more in their life. To do something great.

So check out my website at **[https://mareklexuan.com](https://mareklexuan.com)** and start a new era of your life.
